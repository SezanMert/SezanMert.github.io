## Understanding the Differences between Real and Video Action Perception under Attentional Load

The actions we see in real life possess many features that are left out in Point-Light-Displays. One of these essential features is actability: we usually respond to the actions we see in real life. To understand the differences between real-life actions and video actions under attentional load conditions, we will conduct an EEG study using a novel setup of a transparent screen. While this setup was built, we collected some EEG data with only video actions. I coded this pilot experiment with PsychoPy on Python and collected data from 3 participants. Now, I am analysing it using EEGLAB on MATLAB.
