Welcome to my webpage. I am interested in the processes of the brain. To seek answers to my questions, I am pursuing a master's degree in Neuroscience, and I plan to keep looking for these answers further with a PhD!

I am currently an M.Sc. student in the Neuroscience program at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) and a graduate researcher at the [Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Lab](http://web3.bilkent.edu.tr/ccn/), which is a part of the [National Magnetic Resonance Research Center](https://umram.bilkent.edu.tr) (also known as UMRAM) in [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). I am working on my thesis on modeling attentional processes in biological motion perception using fMRI data with my supervisor, Asst. Prof. Burcu A. Ãœrgen.

I have completed my B.Sc. at the [Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department](https://eee.metu.edu.tr) (EEE) at the [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr). As my passion for neuroscience was evident from my junior year, I selected signal processing and biomedical areas in my senior year as my specializations (we were required to choose at least one specialization area among nine EEE subfields in our senior year in order to graduate; please click [here](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/specialization-fields-and-courses) for more info on these areas). Choosing these two subfields enabled me to see the neurons from the perspective of signal-producing systems and subjects of imaging problems in a complementary manner.

You can find information about my academic interests, projects, and CV on this webpage. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me.
