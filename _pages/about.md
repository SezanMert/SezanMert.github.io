Welcome to my webpage. I am a person who is interested in the processes of the brain. To seek answers to my questions, I am pursuing a master's degree in Neuroscience, and I plan to keep looking for these answers further with a PhD!

I am currently an M.Sc. student in the Neuroscience program at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) and a graduate researcher at the [Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Lab](http://web3.bilkent.edu.tr/ccn/), which is a part of the [National Magnetic Resonance Research Center](https://umram.bilkent.edu.tr) (also known as UMRAM) in [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). I am working on my thesis on modeling attentional processes in biological motion perception using fMRI data with my supervisor, Asst. Prof. Burcu A. Ãœrgen.

You can find information about my academic interests, projects, and CV on this webpage. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me.
