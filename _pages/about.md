Welcome to my webpage. I am interested in the processes of the brain. Currently, I am in pursuit of a master's degree in [Neuroscience](https://web4.bilkent.edu.tr/neuroscience/) at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), driven by the quest for a better understanding of the brain. My aspirations extend beyond this, as I intend to delve deeper into these inquiries by embarking on a journey toward a Ph.D.

I am currently a graduate researcher at the [Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Lab](http://web3.bilkent.edu.tr/ccn/), which is a part of the Aysel Sabuncu Brain Research Center and [National Magnetic Resonance Research Center](https://umram.bilkent.edu.tr) (also known as UMRAM). In my thesis, I am working on modeling attentional processes on biological motion perception by using fMRI data with my supervisor, Assistant Professor Burcu Ayşen Ürgen. 

I earned my B.Sc. in [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://eee.metu.edu.tr) at [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr). My interest in neuroscience became evident during my junior year, prompting me to specialize in signal processing and biomedical areas during my senior year. These choices enabled me to view neurons as signal-producing systems and subjects of imaging problems in a complementary manner.

You can find information about my academic interests, projects, and CV on this webpage. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me.
