Welcome to my webpage. I am a person who is interested in the processes of the brain. To seek answers to my questions, I am pursuing a master's degree in Neuroscience, and I plan to keep looking for these answers further with a PhD!

You can find information about my academic interests, projects, and CV on this webpage. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email me.
