## Teaching Assistant for EEE312 Signals and Systems Course

Undergraduate course, _Bilkent University, Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department_, 2022

For two semesters, I have been assisting with the lab sessions. Also, I prepared and conducted recitation hours.
You may find the solutions that I have prepared for the recitation questions (selected from Signals and Systems by Oppenheim and Willsky).
